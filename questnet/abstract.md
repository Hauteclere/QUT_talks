## Abstract:
Handling and storing personally identifiable information always carries a measure of risk. Mastering that data into a central-source-of-truth repository offers potential benefits, but also opens new and sometimes surprising avenues of risk for us to grapple with. 

As we transition into a more data-driven digital era, master data management becomes an increasingly critical tool. But master data also presents unique challenges in the education space, requiring careful consideration and application.

This presentation explores problems and solutions in one of the major activities required for data mastering - entity resolution, also known as "duplicate detection". We will examine the major error modes that this activity is susceptible to with real-world examples, factors that present barriers to success, and some of the techniques that data professionals can employ to predict and prevent problems.

## Key Presentation Highlights:
- *"Where's Wally, And How Many Of Him Are There?"* Understanding the problem of duplicate detection.
- *"Data Dopplegangers and Unknown Clones."* What happens when entity resolution goes wrong?
- *"Cultural Fingerprints and Self-Selection."* What factors influence the likelihood of entity resolution errors?
- *"The Birthday Paradox And Other Surprises."* How statistical risk sneaks up on us, and why we can't trust our intuition.
- *"Predicting The Future."* How do we quantify risk in this environment, and how reliable are our predictions?
- *"All is not lost."* Insights on what successful entity resolution solutions look like in a world of messy data.

## Value For Attendees
This presentation aims to empower data professionals with a comprehensive understanding of entity resolution challenges and equip them with practical strategies for predictive risk management. Attendees will gain valuable insights into the nuances of data mastering, enabling them to proactively identify and address issues, ultimately fostering more reliable and secure master data solutions.
